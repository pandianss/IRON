# IRON TEAM: Scope & Boundary Constitution

> **Mandate**: Iron Team is a **Cryptographic Coordination Engine**. It exists to formalize human relationships into verifiable Authority structures ("Role Cards") and synchronized rhythms ("Cadences").
> *We govern Structure, not Chat.*

## 1. The Boundary Laws

### 1.1 The Positive Constraints (MUST)
*   **Roles are Keys**: A "Role" (e.g., CTO) is not a label. It is a Keypair that holds specific capabilities (Budget Authority, Code Approval).
*   **Delegation is Explicit**: Authority flows from the Sovereign (Founder/Board) down. Every Role Card must be *issued* (Signed) by a superior key.
*   **Cadence is Mandatory**: A Team without a Sync Rhythm (e.g., Weekly) is just a crowd. The Kernel enforces "Heartbeats".
*   **Dynamic Binding**: A Person can hold multiple Roles. A Role can be held by multiple Persons (Quorum).

### 1.2 The Negative Constraints (NEVER)
*   **No Chat/Slack**: We are not a communication tool. We are an *Organization* tool.
*   **No "Flat" Myths**: Structure exists. We make it explicit ("Code Law") rather than implicit ("Social Capital").
*   **No Abandoned Roles**: If a Role doesn't "Check In" (Heartbeat), it is automatically revoked or flagged.
*   **No Shadow IT**: If a decision requires budget/auth, it *must* happen on-chain (via the Protocol).

## 2. Core Capabilities (In-Scope)

### 2.1 The Role Protocol (L4)
*   **The Card**: A JSON object defining `Scope`, `Budget`, and `Parent`.
*   **The Grant**: A Transaction where `Parent` signs `Card` to `Child_Identity`.
*   **The Revocation**: `Parent` can unilaterally burn the `Card`.

### 2.2 The Sync Protocol (L4)
*   **The Heartbeat**: Team members must sign a "Sync" action every X days.
*   **The Warning**: Missed syncs degrade the "Team Health" metric.
*   **The Ejection**: Chronic silence leads to Role suspension (Automated Gardening).

## 3. Approved Evolution Path

1.  **Squad (Now)**: "We align on a mission." (2-10 people).
2.  **Network (Next)**: "We coordinate across squads." (Federated Roles).
3.  **DAO (Future)**: "We are an autonomous code-law entity." (Smart Contract Governance).

## 4. Scope Rulings

| Feature Proposal | Verdict | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Add Team Chat"** | **REJECT** | Use Slack/Discord. We govern the *decisions*, not the *noise*. |
| **"Organizational Chart Visualization"** | **APPROVE** | **Authority Map**. Visualizing the cryptographic graph is core. |
| **"Performance Review"** | **CONDITIONAL** | Only if based on verifiable metrics (Check-ins, Budgets met). No subjective text fields. |
| **"Expense Approval"** | **APPROVE** | **Budget Authority**. Best use case for Role Cards. |
| **"Calendar Integration"** | **APPROVE** | **Cadence**. Proving a meeting happened (Attestation) is valid. |
