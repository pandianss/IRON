# IRON INTELLIGENCE: Scope & Boundary Constitution

> **Mandate**: Iron Intelligence is a **Verifiable Evolution Engine**. It exists to enable simulated strategy, risk-aware forecasting, and protocol evolution, ensuring that the organization can learn from its own truth without risking its current state.
> *We govern Evolution, not Speculation.*

## 1. The Boundary Laws

### 1.1 The Positive Constraints (MUST)
*   **Zero-Risk Sandbox**: Simulations (L3) must never mutate the live L2 state. All "What-If" scenarios must operate on isolated snapshots.
*   **Evidence-Based Learning**: Every proposed protocol change (Evolution) must be backed by a simulation report proving safety and performance improvements.
*   **Scenario Fidelity**: Forecasts must use actual historical data from the Audit Log (L5) to ensure realistic projections.
*   **War Room Finality**: Decisions made in the "War Room" (High-stakes simulation) must be translated into L4 Protocols for live execution via explicit signature.

### 1.2 The Negative Constraints (NEVER)
*   **No "Predictive Magic"**: We do not use "Black Box" AI for governance. Every forecast must be deterministic and explainable via the Simulation Engine (L3).
*   **No Unbounded Evolution**: You cannot evolve a protocol if it violates a Kernel Invariant (L0).
*   **No Data Synthesis**: We simulate transitions, not data. No generating fake "History".

## 2. Core Capabilities (In-Scope)

### 2.1 The "What-If" Calculator (L3 Adoption)
*   **Strategic Sandbox**: "What if we double our budget?" or "What if 50% of the team misses a check-in?"
*   **Risk Scoping**: Real-time impact analysis of external shocks on internal health.

### 2.2 The War Room (L5 Integration)
*   **Collaborative Modeling**: Multiple roles joining a shared simulation instance.
*   **Decision Replay**: Ability to "Rewind" a simulation to find the exact point of protocol failure.

### 2.3 The Evolution Pipeline (L4/L6)
*   **Protocol Optimization**: Automated suggestion of threshold adjustments (e.g., "Raising the streak requirement because average discipline is high").

## 3. Approved Evolution Path

1.  **Personal Forecast (Now)**: "When will I hit my goal?"
2.  **Strategic Simulation (Next)**: "Can the team survive a 2-week downtime?"
3.  **Autonomous Evolution (Future)**: "The kernel self-optimizes based on successful patterns."

## 4. Scope Rulings

| Feature Proposal | Verdict | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"AI-Generated Strategy"** | **REJECT** | Non-deterministic. Violates "Verifiable Evolution". |
| **"Stress Test Simulation"** | **APPROVE** | **Core Intelligence**. Uses L3 to find breaking points. |
| **"Scenario Comparison Tool"** | **APPROVE** | **Optimization**. Comparing different protocol parameters. |
| **"Sentiment Forecasting"** | **REJECT** | Subjective. Not based on L2 hard metrics. |
| **"Historical Backtest"** | **APPROVE** | **Learning**. Running old intents against new protocols to see "what would have happened". |
